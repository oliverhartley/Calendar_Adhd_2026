Creating a color-coded calendar is one of the most effective strategies for ADHD brains because it reduces "cognitive load"—the energy your brain spends trying to figure out what to do next. Instead of reading every title, you can "feel" the shape of your day through color.

Based on the colors available in your screenshot and your specific meeting types, here is a suggested color strategy designed for clarity and priority:

### **1\. High-Focus & Individual Work (The Most Important)**

Since these are your "anchor" points for getting things done, use a color that stands out but feels calm.

* **Focus Time:** **Grape (Purple)**  
* **Personal/Admin (Email/Catchup):** **Basil (Dark Green)**  
  * *Why:* Purple is distinct from standard meeting colors, signaling "Do Not Disturb." Dark green feels productive for routine tasks.

### **2\. Meetings You Own (Mandatory)**

These require the most energy and preparation. They should be your "alert" color.

* **Color:** **Tomato (Red)**  
* **Logic:** Red acts as a visual "stop sign." When you see red, you know you are the lead and cannot miss it.

### **3\. Small Group / Direct Invitations**

These are the meetings where you are an active participant, but not the leader. Use the response status to manage your energy:

* **If you say YES:** **Peacock (Light Blue)**  
* **If you say MAYBE:** **Banana (Yellow)**  
* **If you say NO:** (These should ideally be removed, but if they stay, use **Graphite/Gray** to make them "recede" into the background).  
  * *Why:* Blue is the standard "work" color. Yellow acts as a "caution" light, reminding you that you haven't fully committed or need to check your energy levels before joining.

### **4\. Global / Large Team Meetings (Low Priority)**

These often clutter the ADHD calendar, making it look busier than it actually is. We want these to be "quiet."

* **If you say YES:** **Sage (Light Green)**  
* **If you say MAYBE:** **Lavender (Light Purple)**  
  * *Why:* These are soft, low-contrast colors. They stay visible so you don't forget them, but they don't "scream" for your attention like the Red or Dark Blue events do.

### **Summary Color Strategy Table:**

| Event Type | Recommended Color | Visual Meaning |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **I am the Owner/Host** | **Tomato (Red)** | 🚨 High Priority / High Prep |
| **Small Meeting (Yes)** | **Peacock (Blue)** | 👤 Active Participation |
| **Focus Time** | **Grape (Purple)** | 🧠 Deep Work / No Distractions |
| **Global/Large Team** | **Sage (Light Green)** | 📢 Information Only / Passive |
| **All "Maybe" RSVPs** | **Banana (Yellow)** | ⚠️ Decision Needed / Tentative |

### **Pro-Tips for the ADHD Calendar:**

1. **The "Gray-Out" Rule:** If you decline a meeting (No), either delete it or turn it **Graphite (Gray)** immediately. This visually tells your brain "this time is actually free."  
2. **Use the "Readiness Training" Label:** I noticed you have a custom label in your screenshot. If "Readiness" is a recurring theme in your week (like in your screenshot), keep using that **Tangerine (Orange)** color for it so your brain associates orange specifically with "Training/Readiness."  
3. **Buffer Zones:** Use **Flamingo (Pink)** to block 15 minutes of "Transition Time" after a Red meeting. ADHD brains often struggle with "task switching," and a splash of pink can remind you to grab water or breathe before the next task.
